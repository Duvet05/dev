The file public/models/thumbnails/cyber-city.glb is intended to be a binary file containing the 3D model data in GLB format. As such, it cannot be represented as text content. You would typically generate or export this file from a 3D modeling software (like Blender) or obtain it from a 3D asset repository.

If you need to create or modify this GLB file, you would do so in a 3D modeling application and then save or export it to the specified path. 

If you need further assistance with the 3D model or how to integrate it into your project, please let me know!
